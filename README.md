UI.X Bootstrap is some HTML and CSS I wrote to make simple pages that integrate nicely with my forums. They can be used with any installation of XenForo with the UI.X theme, however you will need to modify the template to match your forum.

The template itself is blank, and is really only a starting point for creating custom pages.
